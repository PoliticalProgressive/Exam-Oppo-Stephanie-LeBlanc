## Expanding FBI Investigation


### Note Worthy Vulnerabilities

- There was no *publiclly accessable* way to read the link from the [Philidelphia Inquirer] describing the source claiming the FBI expanded their probe. There was a spokesperson for the local DA's office saying the FBI had recently been conducting investigations with staff. This could be pointed out to strengthen and validify the article's claim regarding the FBI's involvement without needing to access the link containing a paywall.

## Lexington, Kentucky Budget 2010
### Profiting on the Prisoners
The Prisoners' Activity Fund (4203) accounts for the operations of the commissary at the Fayette County Detention Center. The budget clearly outlines that the commisary runs at a profit. It does not designate the profit to be re-invested into the employees wages, nor for the detention center to use the profits to increase the quality of life. The profit was directed toward the general fund.
### Enhanced 911 Funds : Indescript large budgetary allocations
> The Enhanced 911 Fund (4204) was created with the FY 1996 budget to account for Enhanced 911 revenues and expenses. A fee of $0.95 per phone line was applied to the phone bills of Fayette County residents on January 1, 1996. This fee was imposed in advance of the system becoming operational in
order to provide funding for database development.
  - There was a substanial amount of funds appropriated/increased to *Professional Services Other*. The *Professional Services Other* funding exceeded 5x the budget allocation for current Civil Service Salaries for the year. 
> Legislation restricts revenues from a tax or fee expressly levied to fund 911
emergency services to be expended solely for 911 services. Since
approximately 33 percent of the calls to Police and Fire for assistance are 911
emergency calls, 33 percent of the calltaker/dispatcher personnel costs are
charged to this fund. 
### Approved for a Projected Change in Market Value of Assets for the City Employee Pension fund of -100.0%
### Approved an Anticipated for a loss of 33% of employer paid contributions to the Police/Fire Safety Pension Fund
- Firefighters and policeman will be more heavily burdened with the cost of their pension.
- They will not have as much overall funding in the pension fund from the city, as per the 2010 budget projections that were approved.
